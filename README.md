# Karaoke
A Karaoke Machine I built in the Java: Data Structures course from Treehouse.

This was a learning tool to teach me how to use Lists, Arrays, Sets, Maps, HashMaps, TreeMaps, Queues (Specifically ArrayDeques) and a lot more. It includes the functionality to add new songs to a permanent database (songs.txt) indexed by artist, to choose a song from that database that a singer wants to sing and add it to the queue of songs, and to play the next song by removing it from the queue and displaying its information.

future updates would include the ability to record the name of the singer who chose each song when it is added to the Queue of upcoming songs, and the functionality of navigating backward in the choose menu (useful for those indecisive nervous singers)

Thanks for reading, and feel free to message me with any questions.
